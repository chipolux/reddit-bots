## Reddit YouTube Bot ##

A bit of code to run as a scheduled task or cron job to post a link to any new videos on a specific youtube channel.

### Setup ###
You'll just need a place to run it from, I prefer renting a VPS from a host like [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=f9b2ce354d85) and setting up cron jobs to run the bot every few minutes.

Then you'll need to get a YouTube Data API v3 key, you can head over to the [Google Developer's Console](https://console.developers.google.com) to get started.

And finally you need to set up a reddit account for the bot to use, make sure to get the account a bit of link karma (2 karma to be precise) so that it won't have to answer captchas every time it needs to post something. You'll probably have to manually post the first few videos to get that sweet karma.
